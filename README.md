## How to use 
The PhantomJS binary from this project can only be use with Linux (64 bits), if you want to use the script on other OS please check the PhantomJS website : http://phantomjs.org/download.html.

Once you're in the folder, type this command in the terminal : `libs/phantomjs main.js yourUsername yourPassword date` (date format is YYYY-MM-DD). Then, wait a bit (~5-10sec) to let the script run.

Example : `libs/phantomjs main.js p62000 mYp4s5w0rd 2018-10-08`
